## Deployment Plan

Deploying a Python/Flask project on AWS involves several key steps:  

1. **Set Up an AWS EC2 Instance**  
   - Choose an appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free-tier users).  
   - Configure security groups to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access.  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Install Python, Flask, and necessary libraries.  
   - Set up a virtual environment and install project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  

3. **Configure Web Server**  
   - Use **NGINX** to serve the Flask app.  
   - Set up **Gunicorn** as the WSGI server to handle requests.  

4. **Set Up a Domain Name**  
   - Configure a **Domain Name System (DNS)** using AWS Route 53.  
   - Point the domain to the EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP address.  

5. **Enable Security and Authentication**  
   - Use **HTTPS** with an SSL certificate (via Let's Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager).  
   - Implement **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication for user sessions.  

6. **Automate Deployment**  
   - Set up **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.  
   - Use AWS CodeDeploy or an SSH-based deployment script.  

7. **Optimize Performance**  
   - Enable **caching** with AWS CloudFront or Flask caching techniques.  
   - Optimize database queries with **indexing**.  

8. **Monitor and Debug**  
   - Use AWS CloudWatch for **monitoring** logs and performance.  
   - Implement **logging** in the Flask app for debugging.  

## Insights from AWS Deployment Documentation  

- AWS EC2 provides flexible compute capacity with security group management.  
- AWS Route 53 allows easy DNS configuration for custom domains.  
- Using **Gunicorn + NGINX** improves scalability and request handling.  
- CloudWatch helps with application monitoring, reducing downtime.  

## Big Idea 4: Internet Concepts & Vocab  

- **HTTP & RESTful APIs**:  
  - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) facilitate API communication.  
  - RESTful APIs ensure structured interactions between frontend and backend.  

- **Domain Name System (DNS)**:  
  - Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.  

- **Security & Authentication**:  
  - JWT is used for session management.  
  - HTTPS encrypts transmitted data to prevent eavesdropping.  

- **Performance Optimization**:  
  - Caching reduces redundant requests.  
  - Database indexing speeds up queries.  

- **Monitoring & Logging**:  
  - AWS CloudWatch provides real-time application insights.  
  - Flask logging records errors for debugging.  

## Conclusion  

Deploying a Flask application on AWS requires a structured approach, balancing security, scalability, and performance. By integrating AWS services like EC2, Route 53, CloudWatch, and proper CI/CD pipelines, we ensure a reliable and efficient deployment process.
