# My AP CSP Study Blog: MCQ Review

## Overview of My MCQ Review Plan

To prepare for the AP CSP multiple choice exam, I’ve been completing **one unit per day** using the **Khan Academy AP CSP course**. This lets me review the full curriculum efficiently and reinforce any concepts I missed during class.

I’m also doing practice MCQ sets from College Board. After each one, I review my wrong answers to identify patterns and weak spots. I’m aiming to do **at least three more full practice sets** before the actual exam.

## Strengths

- **Algorithms:** I’m confident in tracing and understanding algorithms, including nested loops and conditional logic. I’ve practiced writing and evaluating algorithms in different contexts, and can quickly find outputs.
- **Simulation & Randomness:** Our team teach really helped solidify this for me. I understand when simulations are used and how random numbers contribute to modeling real-world situations.
- **Binary & Data Representation:** I can convert between binary and decimal, understand how data is compressed (lossy vs. lossless), and work with ASCII/Unicode characters.

## Weaknesses & What I’m Doing About Them

- **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption:** I often mix these up, especially when it comes to understanding public/private key encryption. I’m using **Quizlet flashcards** and watching short **Khan Academy videos** to review definitions and real-world applications.
- **Citizen Science & Crowdsourcing:** Sometimes it’s hard to distinguish these in MCQs. I’m reviewing vocab and rewatching example videos in Unit 4 to reinforce the difference.
- **Vocabulary-based Questions:** When a question is more about definitions or ethics (instead of logic), I tend to overthink. I’m making a **cheat sheet of key terms** to review regularly.

## What I’ve Learned (By Unit)

### Unit 1: Digital Information
- Learned how binary works to store text, images, and sound.
- Understood compression methods and data abstraction.

### Unit 2: The Internet
- Can explain how DNS, IP, and routing work.
- Learned about fault tolerance, redundancy, and protocols.

### Unit 3: Programming
- Solid on conditionals, loops, and functions.
- Confident writing and reading algorithms.

### Unit 4: Data & Cybersecurity
- Reviewed symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption.
- Learned about digital certificates, phishing, and security breaches.

### Unit 5: Impact of Computing
- Understood big data, citizen science, crowdsourcing.
- Learned about legal and ethical concerns in computing.

## MCQ Practice Progress

| Practice Set | Score   | Notes                             |
|--------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Practice 1   | 60/70   | Missed algorithm-heavy questions  |
| Practice 2   | 62/67   | Improved on binary, Internet      |
| Practice 3   | 66/70   | Still need work on cyber/ethics   |

My scores have consistently improved as I’ve reviewed units and corrected mistakes. I’m seeing progress especially in algorithm-based questions.

## Final Study Plan (Week Before Exam)

- Finish Khan Academy course by May 1st (Currently have completed 57%)
- Take 1 more full MCQ test this weekend and analyze missed Qs
- Do quick rewatch of AP Daily videos for Units 4 and 5

## 2021 MCQ Missed Questions

1. Missed Question 14, about procedures
2. Missed Question 30, How Data is broken into packets
3. Missed Question 60, about RunRoutr, just have to pay more attention to wording questions
