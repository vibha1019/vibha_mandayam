# My AP CSP Study Blog: MCQ Review

## Overview of My MCQ Review Plan

To prepare for the AP CSP multiple choice exam, I’ve been completing **one unit per day** using the **Khan Academy AP CSP course**. This lets me review the full curriculum efficiently and reinforce any concepts I missed during class.

I’m also doing practice MCQ sets from College Board and CodeHS. After each one, I review my wrong answers to identify patterns and weak spots. I’m aiming to do **at least three more full practice sets** before the actual exam.

## Strengths

- **Algorithms:** I’m confident in tracing and understanding algorithms, including nested loops and conditional logic. I’ve practiced writing and evaluating algorithms in different contexts, and can quickly find outputs.
- **Simulation & Randomness:** Our team teach really helped solidify this for me. I understand when simulations are used and how random numbers contribute to modeling real-world situations.
- **Binary & Data Representation:** I can convert between binary and decimal, understand how data is compressed (lossy vs. lossless), and work with ASCII/Unicode characters.

## Weaknesses & What I’m Doing About Them

- **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption:** I often mix these up, especially when it comes to understanding public/private key encryption. I’m using **Quizlet flashcards** and watching short **Khan Academy videos** to review definitions and real-world applications.
- **Citizen Science & Crowdsourcing:** Sometimes it’s hard to distinguish these in MCQs. I’m reviewing vocab and rewatching example videos in Unit 4 to reinforce the difference.
- **Vocabulary-based Questions:** When a question is more about definitions or ethics (instead of logic), I tend to overthink. I’m making a **cheat sheet of key terms** to review regularly.

## What I’ve Learned (By Unit)

### Unit 1: Digital Information
- Learned how binary works to store text, images, and sound.
- Understood compression methods and data abstraction.

### Unit 2: The Internet
- Can explain how DNS, IP, and routing work.
- Learned about fault tolerance, redundancy, and protocols.

### Unit 3: Programming
- Solid on conditionals, loops, and functions.
- Confident writing and reading algorithms.

### Unit 4: Data & Cybersecurity
- Reviewed symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption.
- Learned about digital certificates, phishing, and security breaches.

### Unit 5: Impact of Computing
- Understood big data, citizen science, crowdsourcing.
- Learned about legal and ethical concerns in computing.

## MCQ Practice Progress

| Practice Set | Score   | Notes                             |
|--------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Practice 1   | 60/70   | Missed algorithm-heavy questions  |
| Practice 2   | 62/67   | Improved on binary, Internet      |
| Practice 3   | 66/70   | Still need work on cyber/ethics   |

My scores have consistently improved as I’ve reviewed units and corrected mistakes. I’m seeing progress especially in algorithm-based questions.

## Final Study Plan (Week Before Exam)

- Finish Khan Academy course by May 1st
- Review flashcards 3x this week (focusing on Unit 4 & 5 terms)
- Take 1 more full MCQ test this weekend and analyze missed Qs
- Do quick rewatch of AP Daily videos for Units 4 and 5
