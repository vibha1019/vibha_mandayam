Attending and organizing the student panel with Girls in CS was a great experience! Here are my key takeaways and how I plan to act on them:  

- **CSP and CSA encourage creativity**  
  - Aadit shared that these classes encouraged him to *unleash his creative side*, unlike most traditional classes.  
  - In typical classes, the focus is on **memorization and tests**, but in computer science, **there are no strict limits** to what you can create.  

- **Freedom to explore and innovate**  
  - This inspired me to think differently about CSP as an opportunity to go beyond assignments.  
  - I want to **push myself** to:  
    - Start personal projects  
    - Experiment with new programming concepts  
    - Collaborate with peers on creative ideas

## Notes from Panel

1. **Why Pursue CS?**  
   - Fulfillment from completing projects and contributing to society.  
   - Personal interest in cybersecurity extended into learning CS.  

2. **Importance of Communication:**  
   - Explaining projects helps others support your goals and enhances presentation skills.  
   - In college, you’ll need to explain your code to TAs and peers.  

3. **Project Skills:**  
   - Use tools like Draw.io for flowcharts and follow Agile methodology.  
   - Be open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.  

4. **College Applications:**  
   - Start early and discuss projects in essays by combining technical and ethical aspects.  
   - Adapt essays after writing a few and focus on classes offered for your major.  

5. **Choosing Colleges:**  
   - Consider if you enjoy collaborative projects and the specific majors offered.  
   - AP credits and early graduation can make non-Ivy schools advantageous.  

6. **High School Advice:**  
   - Take dual enrollment courses at community colleges for transferable credits.  
   - Focus on meaningful extracurriculars instead of joining many clubs.  

7. **College Focus:**  
   - GPA matters less; prioritize hands-on projects and technical skills for internships.  

8. **Extracurriculars to Pursue:**  
   - Build websites, compete in CyberPatriot, and explore internships like Northrop Grumman.  
   - Participate in Science Olympiad or research opportunities.  

9. **Internship Tips:**  
   - Message recruiters on LinkedIn and target smaller startups for experience.  
   - First internships don’t need to align with your major, but later ones should.  

10. **Building a Portfolio:**  
    - Create a portfolio website to showcase your projects and make connections at career fairs.
