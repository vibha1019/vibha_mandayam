Attending and organizing the student panel with Girls in CS was a great experience! Here are my key takeaways and how I plan to act on them:  

- **CSP and CSA encourage creativity**  
  - Aadit shared that these classes encouraged him to *unleash his creative side*, unlike most traditional classes.  
  - In typical classes, the focus is on **memorization and tests**, but in computer science, **there are no strict limits** to what you can create.  

- **Freedom to explore and innovate**  
  - This inspired me to think differently about CSP as an opportunity to go beyond assignments.  
  - I want to **push myself** to:  
    - Start personal projects  
    - Experiment with new programming concepts  
    - Collaborate with peers on creative ideas
