Attending and organizing the student panel with Girls in CS was a good experience Here are my key takeaways and how I plan to act on them:

### **Key Lessons from the Panel**
- **CSP and CSA Encourage Creativity**  
  - Aadit shared that these classes helped him be creative, unlike traditional classes focused on **memorization and tests**.  
  - Computer science offers **limitless opportunities** for innovation and creation.

- **Freedom to Explore and Innovate**  
  - This inspired me to see CSP as more than just assignments—it's an opportunity to go beyond expectations.  
  - I plan to:  
    - **Work on personal projects**  
    - **Experiment with new programming concepts**  
    - **Collaborate with peers** to develop creative ideas.  

- **Importance of Job Fairs**  
  - One panelist emphasized how attending job fairs can help you **build your network** and connect with potential opportunities.  
  - Always be proactive and look out for ways to grow your career even in high school

### **Notes from the Panel**

1. **Why Pursue CS?**  
   - Find fulfillment from completing projects and contributing to society.  
   - Extend personal interests (e.g., cybersecurity, robotics, game development) into learning computer science.  

2. **Importance of Communication:**  
   - Explaining your projects improves presentation skills and helps others support your goals.  
   - In college, you’ll often explain code to TAs, professors, and peers.  

3. **Building Project Skills:**  
   - Use tools like **Draw.io** for flowcharts and apply **Agile methodology** for teamwork.  
   - Be open to feedback and actively implement suggestions to improve your work.  

4. **College Applications:**  
   - Start early and include projects in essays, highlighting both technical and ethical aspects.  
   - After writing a few essays, adapt them to save time.  

5. **Choosing the Right College:**  
   - Decide if you enjoy collaborative projects and look into majors that align with your interests.  
   - Consider schools where **AP credits** and early graduation are possible.  

6. **High School Advice:**  
   - Take **dual enrollment courses** at community colleges to earn transferable credits.  
   - Focus on **quality extracurriculars** that you’re passionate about, rather than joining too many clubs.  

7. **College Focus:**  
   - Prioritize hands-on projects and technical skills for internships instead of focusing too much on GPA.  

8. **Extracurricular Activities to Pursue:**  
   - Build websites, compete in **CyberPatriot**, and explore internships like Northrop Grumman.  
   - Get involved in **Science Olympiad** or participate in research opportunities.  

9. **Tips for Internships:**  
   - Reach out to recruiters on **LinkedIn** and start with smaller startups for experience.  
   - Your first internship doesn’t need to align with your major, but later ones should.  

10. **Creating a Portfolio:**  
    - Build a portfolio website to showcase your projects and skills.  
    - Use it to connect with potential employers at job fairs.
