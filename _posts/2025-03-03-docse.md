## 5 Points - 5 Things I Did Over 12 Weeks  

### 1. Full Stack Feature using CRUD Operations  
- Made APIs and a model.  
- First in my group to figure out how to create a full-stack feature.  
- Helped others by explaining the need for Python URI and fetch options.  

### 2. Backend Challenges  
- Figuring out the backend was a challenge for me.  
- It was also a challenge for my teammates, and I was able to help them.  

### 3. Deployment Admin  
- Followed class instructions for deployment commands.  
- Rebuilt the container when the backend needed updates after deployment.  

### 4. Project Organization  
- Kept the project organized by making issues and using Kanban.  
- Created burndown charts when checkpoints were approaching.  

### 5. Coordinated a Video  
- Created a video with my group members.  
- Focused on explaining the project in relation to CPT requirements.
