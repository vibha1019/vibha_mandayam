## 5 Points - 5 Things I Did Over 12 Weeks  

### 1. Full Stack Feature using CRUD Operations  
- Made APIs and a model.  
- Helped both my group and another team by explaining the need for Python URI and fetch options.  

### 2. User Stories  
- Developed the skill of making User Stories, which I had never done before.  
- Helped me realize the actual functionality of my website before jumping right into it.

### 3. Deployment Admin  
- Followed class instructions for deployment commands.  
- Rebuilt the container when the backend needed updates after deployment.  
- Created an issue breaking down Docker commands and shared it with other groups, like Claire's.

### 4. Project Organization

- For example, when N@TM was approaching, I made a staging issue.
