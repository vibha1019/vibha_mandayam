While I was presenting at the CTE Expo, I had the opportunity to meet with a wide range of students, teachers, and community members. It was exciting to share my work and explain the skills Iâ€™ve gained through the computer science pathway. I also got the chance to explore other booths and learn about the variety of CTE classes offered, from engineering and health science to digital media and culinary arts. Talking to other students about their projects helped me appreciate the diverse pathways CTE provides and inspired me to continue exploring hands-on, career-focused learning.
