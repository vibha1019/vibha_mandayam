## Popcorn Hack #2  
Find a website that uses reCaptcha.  
**Example:** The Google login page uses reCaptcha to make sure a real person is trying to log in and not a bot.

## Popcorn Hack #3  
Find a public dataset and describe what it's used for. What do you think are the good and bad things about this dataset?  
**Example:** The **Global Health Observatory (GHO) data** by the World Health Organization (WHO) tracks global health stats, like how common certain diseases are and vaccination rates.  
- **Pros:** It’s reliable, covers lots of countries, and helps with health research.  
- **Cons:** Some data might be old, not every country reports the same way, and there could be gaps in information.

## Hacks

### Question 1  
What is crowdsourcing? Give two examples (that weren’t in the lesson) of how it’s used in different fields.  
**Answer:** Crowdsourcing is when a company or group asks a large number of people to help with a project, usually online. It’s a way to gather ideas, opinions, or work from a lot of different people.  
- **Example 1:** OpenStreetMap – A project where volunteers contribute and update maps to create a free, crowdsourced alternative to Google Maps.  
- **Example 2:** Zooniverse – A platform where everyday people help scientists classify galaxies, transcribe historical documents, and analyze wildlife images.

### Question 2  
Give an example of a successful crowdsourcing project. What was it about, what were its goals, and what good things came from it?  
**Answer:** One example is **Foldit**, a game where people solve puzzles to help scientists figure out how proteins are shaped.  
- **Goals:** To help medical research by understanding proteins better.  
- **Outcomes:** Players actually helped scientists discover an important protein structure that helped with HIV research, proving that gaming and science can work together!

### Question 3  
What are some problems with crowdsourcing? Why do some people dislike it? Give specific examples.  
**Answer:** There are a few downsides to crowdsourcing:
- **Quality issues:** Since anyone can contribute, some information might be wrong or unreliable.
- **Unfair pay:** Some companies use crowdsourcing to get work done for very little money (like Amazon Mechanical Turk, where people do small tasks for a few cents each).
- **Privacy risks:** Sometimes, data collected from crowdsourcing gets used in ways people didn’t agree to (like facial recognition databases built from publicly uploaded photos).

### Question 4  
Find a public dataset that would work for your Pilot City project.  
**Answer:** The **CDC Diabetes Surveillance Data** tracks diabetes rates, risk factors, and health trends across the U.S. This could be really useful for the Pilot City project to understand diabetes trends and create a better interactive glucose education game.
