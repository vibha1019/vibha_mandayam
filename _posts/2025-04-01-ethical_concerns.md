### Popcorn Hack #1:  
**Example of when it is your IP:**
- If you create a unique design or piece of software and sell it, the intellectual property (IP) belongs to you. For example, if you create an app and sell it, the code, design, and branding are your IP.  

**Example of when it is not your IP:**
- If you buy a software license or a product (like a piece of music, an ebook, etc.), you do not own the IP. You have a right to use it under the terms of the license, but the original creator or company holds the IP.  

### Popcorn Hack #2:  
As a computer science student, the best license for my repository would be the **MIT License** because I want to allow others to freely use, modify, and distribute our work with minimal restrictions. The MIT License is popular because it is simple, permissive, and promotes collaboration while still giving you credit for the original work.
