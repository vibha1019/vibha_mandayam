## Self Grade

| Concept                         | Self Grade | Notes |
|----------------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| **DOCSE**                        | 5/5        | Successfully accomplished these 5 things over the trimester, and I feel like I supported it well with Issues, Kanban Boards, and Blogs. |
| **Full Stack Demo**              | 1/2        | Our demo could have used some work, especially the Login feature before we changed it with Mr. Mort's feedback. |
| **Project Feature Blog**         | 1/1        | Successfully addressed all the CPT requirements and showed the code snippets that corresponded to it. |
| **1 Point - MCQ**                | 1/1        | Successfully improved, so hopefully will do well on the AP Test. Need to keep up the practice. |

| **Special 10th Point**           | 1/1        | Talked about my future in CS and how Iâ€™m incorporating feedback from N@Tm to improve my project, and real-life applications of CS. |
