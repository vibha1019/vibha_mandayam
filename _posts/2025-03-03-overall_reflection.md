## Self Grade

| Concept                         | Self Grade | Notes |
|----------------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| **DOCSE**                        | 5/5        | Successfully accomplished these 5 things over the trimester, and I feel like I supported it well with Issues, Kanban Boards, and Blogs. |
| **Full Stack Demo**              | 1/2        | Our demo could have used some work, especially the Login feature before we changed it with Mr. Mort's feedback. |
| **Project Feature Blog**         | 1/1        | Successfully addressed all the CPT requirements and showed the code snippets that corresponded to it. |
| **1 Point - MCQ**                | 1/1        | Successfully improved, so hopefully will do well on the AP Test. Need to keep up the practice. |

| **Special 10th Point**           | 1/1        | Talked about my future in CS and how I’m incorporating feedback from N@Tm to improve my project, and real-life applications of CS. |

### Total: 9/10


## Strengths  

- Able to work together with my group and coordinate projects effectively.  

## Weaknesses  

- Not the most technically sound.  
- Sometimes struggle with presenting my ideas—unsure of the right wording and what to highlight while explaining.  
- To improve, I need more situations like these live reviews since, in the real world, presenting projects is a crucial skill.  

# N@TM Reflection  

A good way to practice this skill is by attending events like N@TM, where I presented our group's feature.  

### Feedback:  

- I received feedback to make the **UI cleaner** and to talk more about my specific **Calendar Feature** during the demo, as a few people were interested in it.  
- *(Could elaborate more here.)*  

### Photos from N@TM:

While I was there, I also checked out some **CSA projects** and came across one that generated **lesson plans** for all CS classes. I found it really interesting because it would make teaching much easier, especially with **200 students and three different CS classes** to manage.  

### Looking Ahead  

As of right now, I am definitely considering majoring in **Computer Science** or a related field like **Data Science** or **Engineering** in college. To prepare for that:  

- I will **definitely be taking CSA next year**.  
- I am applying to **internships related to CS or CS in combination with a physical science**.  
- One example is that I am applying to the **ABLE internship program at UCSD**, which focuses on a different application of CS every week in the 8 week program (data science, AI, Machine Learning, etc). In the programming experience section of the application, I can highlight completing a **full-stack project** and understanding CRUD operations thanks to this class
- In general, **CS is vital to all fields**, and this class has given me a solid foundation. No matter what I end up doing, I hope to apply these skills in the future.
