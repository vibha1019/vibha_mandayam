# Score: 62/67

I am pretty happy with this score for not using any external sources (online info, friends, etc.), but I really need to work on my timing. It took me **1 hour 58 minutes** to complete this test, which isn't ideal considering the real AP test is **2 hours**, and I will obviously be a lot more stressed. However, this is a good starting point and honestly a big improvement from my MCQ taken at the beginning of the trimester.
