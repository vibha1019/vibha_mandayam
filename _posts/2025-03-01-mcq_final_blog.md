# Score: 62/67

I am pretty happy with this score for not using any external sources (online info, friends, etc.), but I really need to work on my timing. It took me **1 hour 58 minutes** to complete this test, which isn't ideal considering the real AP test is **2 hours**, and I will obviously be a lot more stressed. However, this is a good starting point and honestly a big improvement from my MCQ taken at the beginning of the trimester.

## Improvements

The category I noticed the biggest improvement in was definitely **Determining the Result of Code Segments** because I actually understand how to follow code after properly coding throughout the whole trimester.  

## Need to Improve

I really need to work on understanding technical terms. For example, I struggled with questions about **TCP/IP, Certificate Authority, Phishing Attacks**, etc.
