## CPT Requirements  

| **Requirement** | **How My Feature Fulfills the Requirement** |  
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| **Input** | The feature allows users to input events by selecting a date, providing a title and description, and setting optional reminders. This satisfies the requirement for user input. |  
| **Use of List/Collection Type** | The program uses dictionaries to store events for different dates. Each event contains multiple data elements, such as the event title, date, description, and reminder status, which are stored in a structured collection type to efficiently manage multiple events. |  
| **Procedure** | The feature includes a procedure for adding events, which takes parameters like event title, date, description, and reminder settings. Additional procedures handle editing and deleting events, ensuring organized event management. |  
| **Algorithm** | The algorithm for the event calendar includes sequencing (steps to add, edit, and delete events), selection (e.g., checking for date conflicts or filtering events by criteria), and iteration (looping through events to display them in a calendar view). |  
| **Output** | The program displays scheduled events visually on a calendar, listing event details based on user input. This ensures that output dynamically updates based on stored data. |  
| **Functionality Demonstration** | The functionality of adding, editing, and deleting events will be demonstrated in a video, showcasing user interaction with the calendar system and fulfilling the requirement for demonstrating program functionality. |
