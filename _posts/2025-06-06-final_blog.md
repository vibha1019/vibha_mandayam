## Project: GlucoQuest â€“ Gamifying Diabetes Education

**GlucoQuest** is an interactive web-based game I co-developed through a partnership with **Dexcom** and **PilotCity**. Designed to educate users about diabetes in a fun, approachable way, it blends game development, health tech, and data science to create meaningful impact.

This project reflects my ability to combine **technical skill with creativity**, while addressing a real-world issue through technology and design.

### Diabetes Risk Prediction with UCI Dataset

I integrated a **machine learning feature** that predicts a playerâ€™s diabetes risk using real health metrics.

- Trained a **logistic regression model** on the **UCI Diabetes dataset** using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn**.
- Embedded the predictive tool into the game so players could input data and receive real-time, personalized feedback.

This feature shows my strength in **data-driven development**, as well as my ability to apply Python and AI tools for socially impactful solutions.

### My Role: Scrum Master

As the **Scrum Master**, I was responsible for:
- Organizing and leading team stand-ups and sprint planning.
- Managing the Kanban board to assign tasks, track progress, and ensure deadlines were met.
- Facilitating collaboration between frontend, design, and data teams.

## Certification of Homework Success

Over the course of the year, I earned a series of credentials that reflect my consistent completion of AP CSP lessons and my growth as a computer science student. These certifications represent both technical mastery and creative application.

| Credential Type |  Title                         | ðŸ“ˆ Relevance                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Certificate         | **API + Static Data**            | Demonstrated ability to retrieve, parse, and display data from external APIs. |
| Certificate         | **Database + Deployment**        | Gained backend experience using Flask and deployed full-stack applications. |
| Certificate         | **Web Security + Domain**        | Ensured real-world accessibility through custom domains, HTTPS, and security best practices. |
| Certificate         | **JavaScript + Python**          | Built a solid foundation in the two core languages used throughout the course. |
|  NFT              | **Dexcom Simulation Game Design** | Recognized for unique, creative work combining CS and healthcare through GlucoQuest. |
| Portfolio           | **LinkedIn Account**             | Developed a professional profile to connect with peers, mentors, and opportunities. |

Each certificate reflects not just the completion of technical tasks, but my ability to apply those skills in meaningful waysâ€”especially through cross-disciplinary projects like **GlucoQuest** and collaborative tools like GitHub and Trello.

## Showcasing Projects: Night at the Museum (June 2025)

One of the most rewarding parts of the year was presenting **GlucoQuest** at **Night at the Museum (N@tM)** in June 2025. This school-wide event gave students the chance to share their work with families, teachers, and industry professionals.

![GlucoQuest Booth â€“ Screenshot 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/natm2.png)

At my booth, I demonstrated both the core gameplay and the machine learning-based diabetes risk predictor. I explained the technical challenges behind the project, including our use of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, scikit-learn, and deployment tools. I also walked visitors through the **Perfect Plate** leaderboard and our design thinking process.

What made this event especially meaningful was that I got to speak with **former and current Dexcom employees**. Some were impressed enough with our project that they offered to connect us to people at the Dexcom office for a possible visit. It felt more like a real networking event than just a school showcase.

Experiences like N@tM helped me improve my **public speaking**, **technical presentation**, and **real-time demo** skills. It was a great way to learn how to communicate ideas clearly to a non-technical audience while making real professional connections.
