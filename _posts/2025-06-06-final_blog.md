## Project: GlucoQuest â€“ Gamifying Diabetes Education

**GlucoQuest** is an interactive web-based game I co-developed through a partnership with **Dexcom** and **PilotCity**, aimed at educating users about diabetes management in a fun and engaging way. The project combined game development, data science, and public health education to make a real-world impact.

### Diabetes Risk Prediction with UCI Dataset

To take GlucoQuest beyond education, I developed a **machine learning-based diabetes risk prediction tool** as an added feature. Here's how it works:

- Pulled real-world health metrics (age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.) from the **UCI Diabetes dataset**.
- Trained a **logistic regression model** using **Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn** to predict diabetes risk.
- Integrated the prediction output into the game so players could simulate their own risk based on input data and see personalized feedback.

This component added depth to the game and helped bridge education with real-world application of data science and AI.

### Perfect Plate Game

To promote healthy food choices, I added the **Perfect Plate challenge**, where users build a virtual meal with various food options. Based on the nutritional value and balance, each plate receives a score.

- Players are ranked on a **live leaderboard** that encourages replayability and competition.
- Reinforces concepts like **carb counting**, **protein balance**, and **insulin timing** in a game-like format.

### My Role: Scrum Master & Lead Developer

As the **Scrum Master**, I was responsible for:
- Organizing and leading team stand-ups and sprint planning.
- Managing the Kanban board to assign tasks, track progress, and ensure deadlines were met.
- Facilitating collaboration between frontend, design, and data teams.

## Certification of Homework Success

Over the course of the year, I earned a series of credentials that reflect my consistent completion of AP CSP lessons and my growth as a computer science student. These certifications represent both technical mastery and creative application.

| Credential Type |  Title                         | ðŸ“ˆ Relevance                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Certificate         | **API + Static Data**            | Demonstrated ability to retrieve, parse, and display data from external APIs. |
| Certificate         | **Database + Deployment**        | Gained backend experience using Flask and deployed full-stack applications. |
| Certificate         | **Web Security + Domain**        | Ensured real-world accessibility through custom domains, HTTPS, and security best practices. |
| Certificate         | **JavaScript + Python**          | Built a solid foundation in the two core languages used throughout the course. |
|  NFT              | **Dexcom Simulation Game Design** | Recognized for unique, creative work combining CS and healthcare through GlucoQuest. |
| Portfolio           | **LinkedIn Account**             | Developed a professional profile to connect with peers, mentors, and opportunities. |

Each certificate reflects not just the completion of technical tasks, but my ability to apply those skills in meaningful waysâ€”especially through cross-disciplinary projects like **GlucoQuest** and collaborative tools like GitHub and Trello.
