### Individual Feature: Event Calendar

My feature focuses on an event calendar where users can:
1. **Add events** by specifying details such as name, location, and date.
2. **View upcoming events** displayed in an organized and user-friendly calendar interface. 

This feature provides users with a visual and interactive way to keep track of their schedules.

### Lists, Dictionaries, and Database

- **Lists (Rows)**: Queries from the database retrieve rows of event data as Python objects. These rows are used to populate the calendar. We use a third-party library, SQLAlchemy, to perform the queries.

- **Dictionaries (Columns)**: Each row (event) is converted into a dictionary with keys matching database column names usingr read ():

- **Formatting Response Data (JSON) from API into DOM**

  - **The API returns event data in JSON format. After receiving the JSON data, it is formatted and displayed in the DOM using JavaScript.**

- **Methods in the "Class" to Work with Columns (CRUD Operations)**

  - **Create**: Add a new event to the database.

  - **Read**: Retrieve event data from the database (already covered above with the query).

  - **Update**: Modify event data in the database.

  - **Delete**: Remove an event from the database.

## Algorithmic Code

### API Class for CRUD Operations

The API class in the code defines the necessary HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to handle requests for the events data. Hereâ€™s how each method is defined:

![7]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/7.png)

- **POST**: Creates a new event and saves it to the database. It uses the request body data (event name, location, and date) to generate the event and store it in the database.
- **GET**: Retrieves a single event by its ID, returning the event data as a JSON response.
- **PUT**: Updates an existing event's details. The request data specifies which fields (e.g., name, location, date) should be updated.
- **DELETE**: Deletes an event by its ID.

### Method/Procedure with Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration

The `post()` method handles event creation, which involves **sequencing**, **selection**, and **iteration**:

#### Sequencing
The steps are executed in a specific order:

1. **Check for Required Fields**: The method first checks if the required fields (`name`, `location`, `date`) are present in the incoming request. If any are missing, it returns an error response.
2. **Validate Date Format**: The method validates the date format using the `datetime.strptime()` function. If the date format is invalid, it returns an error message specifying the correct format.
3. **Create Event Object**: If all fields are valid, an `Event` object is instantiated using the data from the request.
4. **Save Event to Database**: The `create()` method is then called on the `Event` object to store it in the database.

#### Selection
Selection is used to determine what action to take based on the input:

- If any required fields are missing or invalid, the method returns an error message.
- If all data is valid, it proceeds to create and store the event.

#### Iteration
The `get()` method for retrieving all events by user ID demonstrates iteration. It fetches all the events from the database and iterates over them to generate a list of their JSON representations:

- The `Event.query.all()` fetches all events from the database.
- The method then iterates through the fetched events, using a list comprehension, to generate a JSON response containing the data for each event.

In this case, the method iterates over the events to create a list of their JSON representations, which is then returned as the response.

### Parameters (Request Body) and Return Type (JSONify)

#### Parameters
The parameters for the **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** methods are obtained from the request body. This is done using `request.get_json()`. 

For example, in the **POST** method, the expected parameters are:

- **name**: The name of the event.
- **location**: The location of the event.
- **date**: The date of the event.

#### Return Type
The methods return a **JSON** response using `jsonify()`:

- **POST**: After creating an event, the `post()` method returns the newly created event's data as JSON:

- **GET**: The `get()` method returns the event data as JSON.

- **PUT**: After updating the event, the `put()` method returns the updated event data as JSON.

- **DELETE**: The `delete()` method returns a JSON message confirming the deletion of the event.


<!-- ## Calling Algorithms
 document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      getUserId(pythonURI)  // Get user ID first
          .then(userId => {
              if (userId) {
                  getUserEvents(userId)  // Fetch events based on user ID
                      .then(fetchedEvents => {
                          events = fetchedEvents;  // Store events globally
                          renderCalendar(events);  // Pass events to the calendar
                          renderSidebar(events);   // Pass events to the sidebar
                      })
                      .catch(err => console.error("Error fetching events: ", err));
              }
          })
          .catch(err => {
              console.error("Error fetching user ID: ", err);
          });

          Handling Responses: The frontend updates the calendar or displays error messages based on the response.
