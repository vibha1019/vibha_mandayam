## 🌟 Sprint 1: Frontend Development & SASS

**📝 Summary:**  
In **Sprint 1**, we focused on frontend design, particularly learning **SASS** (*Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets*) and building custom web pages. This sprint introduced me to **customizing website styles** with SASS features like **variables, mixins,** and **nested rules**.

**📚 Key Learnings:**
- **CSS Organization with SASS:**  
   I learned to use SASS for modular, readable CSS by breaking styles into smaller components.
- **Design Principles:**  
   Building web pages allowed me to practice **layout consistency**, **color schemes**, and **typography**.

**🔍 Improvements:**
- **Efficient Code Structure:**  
   By using SASS features like **mixins** to reduce repetitive code, I made my stylesheets more manageable and easy to update.

**💪 Challenges:**
- **Learning Curve with SASS Syntax:**  
   Initially, adjusting to SASS syntax was tricky, especially understanding **mixins** and the **nested structure**. Working on real projects helped reinforce my learning.

## 🖥️ Sprint 2: Teaching Big Idea 3 with Python & JavaScript

**📝 Summary:**  
Sprint 2 was about creating a **lesson plan** around programming fundamentals from Big Idea 3 (variables, loops, conditionals, etc.). I presented a **Tech Talk** and organized **popcorn** and **homework hacks** to actively engage students.

**📚 Key Learnings:**
- **Cross-Language Fundamentals:**  
   Working in **Python** and **JavaScript** highlighted the cross-language nature of programming concepts, deepening my understanding of each.
- **Lesson Planning and Grading:**  
   Developing a lesson and grading plan taught me how to simplify complex concepts and engage students effectively.

**🔍 Improvements:**
- **Communication Skills:**  
   Explaining programming concepts concisely improved my technical communication skills. I became more interactive and efficient when engaging students.
- **Confidence in Leading Activities:**  
   Running popcorn hacks helped build my confidence in guiding others through coding challenges.

**💪 Challenges:**
- **Balancing Tech Talk & Activities:**  
   It was challenging to keep the Tech Talk portion under five minutes while providing enough background. Revising my material multiple times helped me find the right balance.

## 📱 Sprint 3: Social Media Page with Frontend and Backend Integration

**📝 Summary:**  
In **Sprint 3**, we built a **social media page** that collects and stores user-uploaded posts in a **backend database** connected to the frontend. This involved integrating frontend and backend components for a dynamic web experience.

**📚 Key Learnings:**
- **Backend Integration & Database Management:**  
   I learned the fundamentals of setting up a backend, collecting user data, and storing it in a database. Understanding how front-end actions update and retrieve data from the backend was a valuable skill.
- **Full-Stack Development:**  
   This sprint introduced me to full-stack development. I saw firsthand how frontend design and backend logic work together to provide a seamless user experience.

**🔍 Improvements:**
- **Database Skills:**  
   Working with databases improved my skills in data structuring and retrieval. I now feel more confident using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data.
- **Debugging Across Systems:**  
   I got better at debugging by identifying issues in both the frontend and backend, which involved inspecting network requests, database entries, and frontend visuals.

**💪 Challenges:**
- **Connecting Frontend and Backend Components:**  
   Integrating the backend with the frontend required troubleshooting various connectivity issues. Resolving these helped me become more resilient in problem-solving.
