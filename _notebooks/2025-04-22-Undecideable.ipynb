    "The Post Correspondence Problem is an undecidable problem introduced by Emil Post in 1946. Given two lists of strings over some alphabet (say, List A and List B), the goal is to determine whether there exists a sequence of indices that, when used to concatenate corresponding strings from both lists, results in the same string.\n",
