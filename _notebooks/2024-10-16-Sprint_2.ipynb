    "My personal accomplishment of Sprint 2 was creating an engaging lesson that effectively taught my classmates about nested conditionals. I was able to gauge their level of understanding by the class’s overall performance on the Kahoot we created. The average Kahoot score was high, and therefore, my lesson was successful. I also learned many different parts of the Python and Javascript languages and feel much more comfortable with these languages than before because of my classmates’ lessons.\n",
