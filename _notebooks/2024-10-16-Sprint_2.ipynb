    "In Sprint 2, my biggest achievement was creating a lesson that made learning about nested conditionals fun and effective. I could tell the class understood the material because they did really well on the Kahoot quiz we made. The high average score showed that the lesson worked. I also gained a better understanding of Python and JavaScript thanks to the lessons from my classmates, and I now feel more confident using both languages."
